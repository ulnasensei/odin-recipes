            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Chicken</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Cut each chicken breast in half lengthwise to create two cutlets, four total.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and paprika. Evenly
                    season both sides of the chicken with the spice mixture.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the olive oil.
                    Add the chicken and cook until the surface is browned, about 5 for 6 minutes.
                    Flip and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 to 165ºF (71 to 74ºC),
                    about 5 to 7 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Wash and dry the pan to
                    use for making the alfredo sauce.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Pasta</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 ½ teaspoon salt, stir
                    to dissolve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes, or according to
                    the manufacturer's directions. Use tongs to transfer to a colander—Reserve the
                    starchy pasta water. While the pasta cooks, make the alfredo sauce.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Alfredo Sauce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter. Once melted, add garlic
                    and saute until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Do not brown the butter or garlic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the heavy cream, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, stir to combine.
                    Bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, frequently stirring,
                    scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to make sure the cream does not curdle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce the sauce to about 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. It should be slightly
                    thickened and be able to coat the back of a spoon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese and nutmeg. If the sauce is
                    too thick, add water or cream. Add 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the
                    desired consistency—season with salt and pepper to taste.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>To Serve</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the pasta to the sauce, gently tossing to combine.</li>
                <li>Slice the chicken against the grain into ½-inch thick pieces.</li>
                <li>Divide the pasta among bowls, top with sliced chicken and chopped parsley.</li>
            </ol>
