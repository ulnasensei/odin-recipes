            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <h4>Meat Sauce</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Set the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190ºC).
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large pan heat olive oil over medium-low heat and sauté onion and garlic
                    until onions are translucent about 3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn heat to medium-high, add beef and sausage to the pan. Break the meat up
                    into smaller pieces and cook until no traces of pink remain, about 5 minutes.
                    Season meat with 1 ½ teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add tomato paste and stir until combined, cook for 1 minutes. Stir in crushed
                    tomatoes and simmer over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally for 30 minutes.
                    Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Lasagna</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bring water and 1 tablespoon salt to a boil. Cook pasta according to package
                    directions, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until al dente, about 8
                    minutes. Carefully remove the lasagna noodles and transfer them to a sheet pan
                    lined with clean kitchen towels. Place them in a single layer, to keep them from
                    sticking together. Set aside until ready to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a medium-sized bowl whisk together eggs, ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, ½
                    teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and chopped parsley.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reserve about 1 cup of meat sauce and 1 cup of grated mozzarella cheese for
                    topping the lasagna. Lightly coat a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish with oil. Add
                    just enough sauce to lightly cover the bottom of the dish to prevent sticking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Layer 3 to 4 sheets of lasagna, top with ⅓ of ricotta cheese mixture, ⅓ meat
                    sauce, and ⅓ of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat for 2 more layers. On the top
                    layer pour the reserved meat sauce and cover evenly with the reserved mozzarella
                    cheese.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Line a sheet tray with foil and place the lasagna tray on top. Loosely cover
                    with foil, making sure not to touch the top with the cheese. Bake for 30
                    minutes, then remove the foil. Bake until the cheese is hot and bubbly on top,
                    about 15 minutes. The lasagna can be brolied for a few minutes right before
                    removing from the oven for an extra browned crust.
                </li>
                <li>Before slicing, allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes.</li>
